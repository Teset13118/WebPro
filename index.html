            <h1 class="ghost">HTML basics</h1>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, 
                content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. 
                As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
                <h1 class="ghost">So what is HTML?</h1>
                <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, 
                    which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a 
                    certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can 
                    make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:</p>
                <div class="codebox">
                    <h4>My cat is very grumpy</h4>
                </div>
                <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>
                <div class="codebox">
                    <img src="pic\code1.png" class="codeex">
                </div>
            <h1 class="ghost">Anatomy of an HTML element</h1>
            <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
            <img src="pic\tag1.png" class="tagex">
            <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. 
                    This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
                <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states 
                    where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors 
                    and can lead to strange results.</li>
                <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
            <img src="pic/tag2.png" class="tagex">
            <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is
                 the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique 
                 identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and 
                 other things. Some attributes have no value, such as required.</p>
            <p>Attributes that set a value always have:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
                <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h1 class="ghost">Nesting elements</h1>
            <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we 
                could wrap the word "very" in a &lt;strong&gt; element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code2.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the &lt;p&gt; element first, 
                then the &lt;strong&gt; element; therefore, we have to close the &lt;strong&gt; element first, then the &lt;p&gt; element. The following is 
                    incorrect:</p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code3.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap as 
                shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to say, which can lead to 
                unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>
            <h1 class="ghost">Void elements</h1>
            <p>Some elements have no content and are called void elements. Take the &lt;img&gt; element that we already have in our HTML page:</p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code4.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing &lt;</img>&gt; tag and no inner content. This is because an image element 
                doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.</p>
            <h1 class="ghost">Anatomy of an HTML document</h1>
            <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual 
                elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put into our index.html example (which we 
                first met in the Dealing with files article):</p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code5.png" class="codeex big">
            </div>
            <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were 
                    meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic
                     error checking and other useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your
                      document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.</li>
                <li>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; — the &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. 
                    It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.</li>
                <li>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; — the &lt;head&gt; element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the 
                    content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in 
                    search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</li>
                <li>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast
                     majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set 
                     this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li>
                <li>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt; — This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing 
                    mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.</li>
                <li>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; — the &lt;title&gt; element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is 
                    loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</li>
                <li>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; — the &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether 
                    that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
            </ol>
            <h1 class="ghost">Images</h1>
            <p>Let's turn our attention to the &lt;img&gt; element again:</p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code6.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which 
                contains the path to our image file.</p>
            <p>We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In the alt attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see 
                the image, possibly because of the following reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the 
                    alt text to them.</li>
                <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your src 
                    attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="pic/tag3.png" class="tagex">
            <p>The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have 
                a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better 
                alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."</p>
            <p>Try coming up with some better alt text for your image now.</p>
            <h1 class="ghost">Marking up text</h1>
            <p>This section will cover some essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.</p>
            <h3 class="smallghost">eadings</h3>
            <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book 
                has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;, although
                     you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:</p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code7.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <p>Now try adding a suitable title to your HTML page just above your <img> element.</p>
            <h3 class="smallghost">Paragraphs</h3>
            <p>As explained above, &lt;p&gt; elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:</p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code8.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <p>Add your sample text (you should have it from What will your website look like?) into one or a few paragraphs, placed directly below 
                your &lt;img&gt; element.</p>
            <h3 class="smallghost">Lists</h3>
            <p>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements.
                 The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a &lt;ul&gt; element.</li>
                <li>Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an &lt;ol&gt; element.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Each item inside the lists is put inside an &lt;li&gt; (list item) element.</p>
            <p>For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list</p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code9.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <p>We could modify the markup to this</p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code10.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <p>Try adding an ordered or unordered list to your example page.</p>
            <h1 class="ghost">Links</h1>
            <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — &lt;a&gt; — "a" being the short form for 
                "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:</p>
           <ol>
                <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
                <li>Wrap the text in an &lt;a&gt; element, as shown below:</li>
                    <div class="codebox">
                        <img src="pic/code11.png" class="codeex">
                    </div>
                <li>Give the &lt;a&gt; element an href attribute, as shown below:</li>
                    <div class="codebox">
                        <img src="pic/code12.png" class="codeex">
                    </div>
                <li>Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to:</li>
                    <div class="codebox">
                        <img src="pic/code13.png" class="codeex">
                    </div>
            </ol>
            <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address.
                 After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.</p>
            <p>Add a link to your page now, if you haven't already done so.</p>
        </div>

            <h1 class="ghost">CSS basics</h1>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. 
                We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) 
                layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</p>
            <h1 class="ghost">What is CSS?</h1>
            <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what 
                you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:</p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code14.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <p>Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS (above) into a new file. Save the file as 
                style.css in a directory named styles.</p>
            <p>To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your HTML document. Otherwise, the styling won't change 
                the appearance of the HTML. (If you haven't been following our project, pause here to read Dealing with files and HTML basics.)</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open your index.html file. Paste the following line in the head (between the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; tags):</li>
                        <div class="codebox">
                            <img src="pic/code15.png" class="codeex">
                        </div>
                <li>Save index.html and load it in your browser. You should see something like this:</li>
                        <img src="pic/website-screenshot-styled.png" class="tagex fox">
            </ol>
            <p>If your paragraph text is red, congratulations! Your CSS is working.</p>
            <h3 class="smallghost">Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h3>
            <p>Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works:</p>
            <img src="pic/tag4.png" class="tagex fox">
            <p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) 
                Note the names of the individual parts:</p>
            <h3 class="smallghost">Selector</h3>
            <p>This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). 
                To style a different element, change the selector.</p>
            <h3 class="smallghost">Declaration</h3>
            <p>This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</p>
            <h3 class="smallghost">Properties</h3>
            <p>These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.) 
                In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</p>
            <h3 class="smallghost">Property value</h3>
            <p>To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances 
                for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</p>
            <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
                <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
                <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them separated by semicolons, like this:</p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code16.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <h3 class="smallghost">Selecting multiple elements</h3>
            <p>You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas. For example:</p>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code17.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <h3 class="smallghost">Different types of selectors</h3>
            <p>There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use element selectors, which select all elements of a given type. But we can
                 make more specific selections as well. Here are some of the more common types of selectors:</p>
            <table>

            <p>Now that we've explored some CSS fundamentals, let's improve the appearance of the example by adding more rules 
                    and information to the style.css file.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, find the output from Google Fonts that you previously saved from What will your website look like?. Add 
                        the &lt;link> element somewhere inside your index.html's head (anywhere between the &lt;head> and &lt;/head> tags). It 
                        looks something like this:</li>
                <div class="codebox">
                    <img src="pic/code18.png" class="codeex">
                </div>
                <p>This code links your page to a style sheet that loads the Open Sans font family with your webpage.</p>
                <li>Next, delete the existing rule you have in your style.css file. It was a good test, but let's not continue 
                    with lots of red text.</li>
                <li>Add the following lines (shown below), replacing the font-family assignment with your font-family selection from What 
                    will your website look like?. The property font-family refers to the font(s) you want to use for text. This rule defines 
                    a global base font and font size for the whole page. Since <html> is the parent element of the whole page, all elements 
                        inside it inherit the same font-size and font-family.</li>
                <div class="codebox">
                    <img src="pic/code19.png" class="codeex">
                </div>
                <li>Now let's set font sizes for elements that will have text inside the HTML body (&lt;h1>, &lt;li>, and &lt;p>). We'll also center
                     the heading. Finally, let's expand the second ruleset (below) with settings for line height and letter spacing to 
                     make body content more readable.</li>
                <div class="codebox">
                    <img src="pic/code20.png" class="codeex">
                </div>
            </ol>
            <p>Adjust the px values as you like. Your work-in-progress should look similar to this:</p>
            <img src="pic/website-screenshot-font-small.png" class="tagex fox">
            <h1 class="ghost">CSS: all about boxes</h1>
            <p>Something you'll notice about writing CSS: a lot of it is about boxes. This includes setting size, color, and position.
                 Most HTML elements on your page can be thought of as boxes sitting on top of other boxes.</p>
            <img src="pic/boxes.jpg" class="tagex fox">
            <p>CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up space on your page has properties like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>padding, the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.</li>
                <li>border, the solid line that is just outside the padding.</li>
                <li>margin, the space around the outside of the border.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="pic/box-model.png" class="tagex fox">
            <p>In this section we also use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>width (of an element).</li>
                <li>background-color, the color behind an element's content and padding.</li>
                <li>color, the color of an element's content (usually text).</li>
                <li>text-shadow sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element.</li>
                <li>display sets the display mode of an element. (keep reading to learn more)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To continue, let's add more CSS. Keep adding these new rules at the bottom of style.css. 
                Experiment with changing values to see what happens.</p>
            <h3 class="smallghost">Changing the page color</h3>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code21.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <p>This rule sets a background color for the entire page. Change the color code to the color you
                 chose in What will my website look like?.</p>
            <h3 class="smallghost">Styling the body</h3>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code22.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <p>There are several declarations for the &lt;body> element. Let's go through these line-by-line:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>width: 600px; This forces the body to always be 600 pixels wide.</li>
                <li>margin: 0 auto; When you set two values on a property like margin or padding, the first value affects 
                    the element's top and bottom side (setting it to 0 in this case); the second value affects the left and 
                    right side. (Here, auto is a special value that divides the available horizontal space evenly between left
                     and right). You can also use one, two, three, or four values, as documented in Margin Syntax.</li>
                <li>background-color: #FF9500; This sets the element's background color. This project uses a reddish orange for 
                    the body background color, as opposed to dark blue for the &lt;html> element. (Feel free to experiment.)</li>
                <li>padding: 0 20px 20px 20px; This sets four values for padding. The goal is to put some space around the content.
                     In this example, there is no padding on the top of the body, and 20 pixels on the right, bottom and left. The 
                     values set top, right, bottom, left, in that order. As with margin, you can use one, two, three, or four values,
                      as documented in Padding Syntax.</li>
                <li>border: 5px solid black; This sets values for the width, style and color of the border. In this case, it's a five-pixel–
                    wide, solid black border, on all sides of the body.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="smallghost">Positioning and styling the main page title</h3>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code23.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <p>You may have noticed there's a horrible gap at the top of the body. That happens because browsers apply default styling 
                to the h1 element (among others). That might seem like a bad idea, but the intent is to provide basic readability for 
                unstyled pages. To eliminate the gap, we overwrite the browser's default styling with the setting margin: 0;.</p>
            <p>Next, we set the heading's top and bottom padding to 20 pixels.</p>
            <p>Following that, we set the heading text to be the same color as the HTML background color.</p>
            <p>Finally, text-shadow applies a shadow to the text content of the element. Its four values are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The first pixel value sets the horizontal offset of the shadow from the text: how far it moves across.</li>
                <li>The second pixel value sets the vertical offset of the shadow from the text: how far it moves down.</li>
                <li>The third pixel value sets the blur radius of the shadow. A larger value produces a more fuzzy-looking shadow.</li>
                <li>The fourth value sets the base color of the shadow.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Try experimenting with different values to see how it changes the appearance.</p>
            <h3 class="smallghost">Centering the image</h3>
            <div class="codebox">
                <img src="pic/code24.png" class="codeex">
            </div>
            <p>Next, we center the image to make it look better. We could use the margin: 0 auto trick again as we did for the body. 
                But there are differences that require an additional setting to make the CSS work.</p>
            <p>The &lt;body> is a block element, meaning it takes up space on the page. The margin applied to a block element will be 
                respected by other elements on the page. In contrast, images are inline elements, for the auto margin trick to work 
                on this image, we must give it block-level behavior using display: block;.</p>
