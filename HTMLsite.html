            <h1>HTML basics</h1>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, 
                content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. 
                As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
                <h1>So what is HTML?</h1>
                <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, 
                    which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a 
                    certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can 
                    make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:</p>
                <div class="codebox">
                    <h4>My cat is very grumpy</h4>
                </div>
                <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>
                <div class="codebox">
                    <img src="pic\code1.png" class="codeex">
                </div>
            <h1>Anatomy of an HTML element</h1>
            <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
            <img src="pic\tag1.png" class="tagex">
            <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. 
                    This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
                <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states 
                    where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors 
                    and can lead to strange results.</li>
                <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
            <img src="pic/tag2.png" class="tagex">
            <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is
                 the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique 
                 identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and 
                 other things. Some attributes have no value, such as required.</p>
            <p>Attributes that set a value always have:</p>
